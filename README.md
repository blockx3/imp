# Idea Media Platform

In short IMP,it is not a social media platform but rather it is an idea media platform (obviously).This project is a part of our organization because as our community grow we will accept ideas of project, apps, website & all. So, this platform will be used to share ideas, discuss about them, and also to get feedback from the community. Based on the response we will decide whether to allow the start of project or not.

## Who is building this?

Answer is `Community` | Hacktoberfest if ramping up and what could be the best time other than this.Go Check the Issues and start contributing. Before that have a look at the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file and [Discussions](https://github.com/blockx3/imp/discussions)

## Features to implement in IMP

- Registration with a username (username can be anything available).
- People can write a post with the idea. The post will be MarkDown formatted.
- Community can UP VOTE, DOWN VOTE, and COMMENT on the post.
- The post can be tagged with a label. eg. `#webdev`, `#MobileApp`, `#AI`, `#BlockChain`, etc.
- People can search for posts based on the label.
- Very minimal and clean UI.
